- [ ] What are RSCs?

  - [ ] Previously frameworks like Next and Gatsby had their own way to do SSR. RSC are 1st party solution to implement SSR.

  - [ ] Server components are React components that only render on the server.

  - [ ] As a result, they can't create new state variables (they wouldn't be able to re-render if the state changed!).
        They also can't consume context, or use effects. They're a small subset of a typical React component.

  - [ ] But because we arenâ€™t concerned about rerenders, we can have components that call async functions directly!

  - [ ] All of this happens on the server, before the HTML file is sent to the client

  - [ ] The components that we are used to are referred to as Client Components in this new paradigm.
        Somewhat confusingly, the are still render on the server but unlike server components,
        they can be rerendered on client side, once the JS bundle has been downloaded.
